-I will be exporting FBX and replacing ASCII file and naming it PROPERLY later

-A quick test after 16 hours of weighting has confirmed that the weighting is more or less proper; all joints bend where they should
	-all geo is manipulated at each joint the way it should

-Some geo bends a little weird at some joints; I will take a look at that and see if I can possibly fix it

-The rig is more or less operable, and in a state whereby I can actually make the animations

PS: I DID NOT EXPECT WEIGHTING TO TAKE 16 HOURS
	-Geo would break in places when removing weight at various vertices, and saving without noticing till too late forced me to revert
	to previous save increment
	-At one point, a joint on the rig moved out of place and could not be fixed
	-HOWEVER, it has been done and animation can commence
